# One can find the following:

- Papers for the optimal CVaR portfolio obtained from fast gradient descent and construction of the implied volatility surface
- Code that constructs an implied volatility surface from 5 weeks of NIFTY 50 index options data
- Code that uses the Breeden-Litzenerger formula to construct the probability distribution of the stock price at different maturities, used for simulating the stock price.
- Notebook that implements the Dupire's Local stochastic volatility model to construct the volatility surface and checks for arbitrage opportunities including violation of put-call parity.
- Notebook for the fast gradient descent using the Breeden-Litzenberger simulations.
